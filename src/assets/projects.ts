      'I integrated RTK Query with optimistic updates for likes, enabling a smoother user experience. I also implemented the Google Maps API and performed unit testing to ensure robust functionality. On the /all_events page, I developed advanced filters, improving event search and categorization. I created a form for the /user_profile page, enhancing user profile management. In addition, I resolved multiple bugs, ensuring the application runs seamlessly. I addressed design inconsistencies, aligning the implementation with Figma prototypes to improve visual consistency. I also provided ongoing support to other developers, assisting with technical challenges and code review.',

The calendar supports custom theming and localization. It was built from scratch and published as a reusable npm package for use in other apps.',
